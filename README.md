# :robot: Mars Rover Tech Challenge :robot:
My TDD solution to Google's Mars Rover Technical Challenge. You can check out the challenge in the following link: https://code.google.com/archive/p/marsrovertechchallenge/

## :clipboard: About the Challenge
This exercise is a simple technical problem created by Google. Its aim is not about making the code "work" but about finishing it through testing practices.
>We highly recommend using a unit testing framework such as JUnit or NUnit. Even if you have not used it before, it is simple to learn and incredibly useful. The code you write should be of production quality, and most importantly, it should be code you are proud of.

The problem consist on making a finite number of Rover robots move in a plateau on Mars by making them follow simple instructions.


## :hammer_and_wrench: Technical Specifications
- The IDE I am using to complete the challenge is [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/).

- I am using the 5th version of JUnit, [JUnit Jupiter](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/), for the testing part.

- The Java code is writen in [Java 11](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html).

- The build automation tool is [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).
